## Haiku

A tool to help you write Haikus in ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ PT-PT and ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· PT-BR.

Note: Portuguese makes heavy usage of characters that are not in the English
alphabet - e.g. "Ã³", "Ã§", "Ã©", etc. Writing "olÃ¡" or "Ã³nibus" is therefore
different from writing "ola" and "onibus". So, words missing accents where they
are required are fundamentally different from the ones that have them ("ola" vs
"olÃ¡"), or they might not even be words at all (like "onibus"). This service is
not yet ready to support this sort of cases, so accents are required.

## Server

The enterity of the infrastructure is on Deta, requiring little to no
intervention on our end.

At the moment we have only one micro/cloud function, named `syllables`. It
currently requires no authentication whatsoever (although we may be adding
API keys in the future). It is served over HTTPS, managed by Deta.

It's our whole API, providing endpoints to determine the number of syllables in
a word, line or set of lines.

We don't rely on any WSGI server as Deta has its own, which wraps every micro
it runs.

### Local development

#### Venv

We use Python v3.9.13 (this is because Deta - our infrastructure - supports only
versions 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9).

- Go to `micros/syllables`
- Run `python3 -m venv venv` to create the virtual environment
- Activate it: `source venv/bin/activate`
- Make sure you're picking up the virtual environment: `which python3`,
  `which pip` - these should print out results from your local virtual
  environment

#### Environment variables

We make use of `.env` files to store environment variables. `.env` is used
for local development, whereas `.env.prod` is used to track environment
variables for the production environment.

#### Makefile

All the make commands you see referenced here are relative to the one function
described above.

- Run `make install-dev` to install all dependencies needed for local
  development

`make install` is also available (production dependencies only) but since Deta
only looks at `requirements.txt` you will likely won't ever need to run this
command (unless you're deplyoing to some other target).

- Run `make run` to run the server locally

#### Typechecking

This project uses mypy. Run it with `make typecheck`.

#### Formatting

This project uses black to format code. Run it with `make format`.

### Deployments

We deploy on Deta. Deta will look for dependencies declared in
`requirements.txt` so make sure you have this file (it's already in the repo).

To deploy a micro run `make deploy` in the micro's directory. This will also
update enviroment variables on Deta - these are stored in `.env.prod`.

### Logging

We rely on Deta's logging (aka "visor").

- Run `make logs enable` to enable visor (`make logs disable` to disable them).

- Run `make logs open` to open the logs in your default web browser.
